# ePUB to reMarkable Converter
This is a web application to convert epubs into a PDF compatible with the reMarkable Paper Pro and Boox Air 4C.

This project has been heavily influenced by AI tooling of claude.ai.

> [!CAUTION]
> Due to the software architecture and the handling of temporary files and downloads I strongly recommend not to use it as a public webservice.
